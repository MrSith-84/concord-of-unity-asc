          <h3>Origins & Motivation</h3>
          <p>Born of fear as the Consortium rose, isolated systems banded together under the desperate cry for survival. Their <strong>creed: Unity against darkness.</strong> They see themselves as guardians of civilization, the last bulwark against the spreading shadow of the Apex Separatist Consortium.</p>
          <p>Yet beneath their noble proclamations lies harsh reality—<em>beneath unity lies dissonance</em>. Fallen empires, greedy corporations, fanatical zealots, and fractured militias, all forced together not by shared ideals but by mutual fear of annihilation.</p>

          <h3>Role in the Galactic Struggle</h3>
          <p>The Concord of Unity stands as <strong>the shield against the Consortium's blade.</strong> They claim to defend civilization itself, positioning themselves as the moral alternative to the Consortium's rule through strength. However, the very fractures that drove them together may ultimately undo them.</p>
          
          <h3>Resources & Capabilities</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Industrial Hubs:</strong> Control of inner system manufacturing centers</li>
            <li><strong>Massive Fleets:</strong> Enormous armadas, though often outdated and poorly coordinated</li>
            <li><strong>Corporate Backing:</strong> Financial support from powerful cartels seeking stability</li>
            <li><strong>Religious Orders:</strong> Zealous faithful providing morale and ideological unity</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Fatal Weaknesses</h3>
          <p>The Concord's strength is also its greatest vulnerability:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Fragile Unity:</strong> Allies constantly distrust each other's motives</li>
            <li><strong>Bureaucratic Paralysis:</strong> Critical decisions delayed by committee</li>
            <li><strong>Competing Agendas:</strong> Corporations, zealots, and militarists pulling in different directions</li>
            <li><strong>Infiltration:</strong> Constant penetration by Ghost Legion spies and Specter Network manipulators</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Hierarchical Structure</h3>
          <p>The Concord's structure reflects its fractured nature—a marriage of convenience between competing power blocs:</p>

          <h3>Methods & Tactics</h3>

          <h4>Defensive Warfare</h4>
          <p><strong>Primary Strategy:</strong> Fortress worlds protected by massive planetary shields and orbital defense networks</p>
          <p><strong>Fleet Deployment:</strong> Concentrated defensive positions rather than offensive strikes</p>
          <p><strong>Doctrine:</strong> Make every Consortium victory so costly that expansion becomes unsustainable</p>

          <h4>Economic Blockades</h4>
          <p><strong>Trade Disruption:</strong> Systematic choking of Consortium smuggling routes and commercial traffic</p>
          <p><strong>Resource Denial:</strong> Preventing access to critical materials needed for Consortium expansion</p>
          <p><strong>Financial Warfare:</strong> Corporate cartels using economic leverage against Consortium allies</p>

          <h4>Propaganda of Light</h4>
          <p><strong>Narrative Control:</strong> Systematic portrayal of the Consortium as devils incarnate</p>
          <p><strong>Moral Authority:</strong> Positioning the Concord as civilization's last defenders</p>
          <p><strong>Counter-Intelligence:</strong> Combating Specter Network information operations</p>

          <h4>Mercenary Contracts</h4>
          <p><strong>Force Multiplication:</strong> Employing outside contractors to supplement fractured military</p>
          <p><strong>Plausible Deniability:</strong> Using mercenaries for operations they cannot officially sanction</p>
          <p><strong>Risk Management:</strong> Keeping their own forces intact while others bear casualties</p>

          <h3>The Doctrine of Unity</h3>
          <p><strong>Core Principle:</strong> Overwhelming coordination to compensate for individual weakness</p>
          <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Massive fleet actions combining all member forces</p>
          <p><strong>Reality:</strong> Often devolves into chaos due to incompatible command structures and competing priorities</p>

          <h3>Notable Campaigns & Failures</h3>
          
          <h4>The Bastion War</h4>
          <p><strong>Hero:</strong> Admiral Lysara Veylan held Titan Order siege for three months through mines, feints, and guerrilla tactics</p>
          <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Tactical success, strategic stalemate</p>
          <p><strong>Legacy:</strong> "The Bastion's Flame" became symbol of defiance against overwhelming power</p>

          <h4>The Silent Betrayal of Damaris Prime</h4>
          <p><strong>Incident:</strong> Damaris Prime lowered planetary shields mid-battle, allowing Voidborn fleet to devastate Concord forces</p>
          <p><strong>Aftermath:</strong> Complete destruction of defending fleet, massive loss of life</p>
          <p><strong>Theories:</strong> Voidborn bribes, Ghost Legion infiltration, or simple sabotage</p>
          <p><strong>Impact:</strong> "Never again Damaris" became rallying cry and cautionary tale</p>

        <!-- Relations Tab -->
        <div class="tab-panel" id="relations">
          <h3>Relationships with the Consortium</h3>

          <h4>Ghost Legion</h4>
          <p><strong>Status:</strong> Mortal Enemies</p>
          <p><strong>Nature:</strong> Eternal war between secrets and spies</p>
          <p><strong>Reality:</strong> Ghost Legion operatives are constantly infiltrating Concord leadership, while Concord counter-intelligence works desperately to root them out. Every major Concord decision is potentially compromised by Legion plants.</p>

          <h4>Voidborn Syndicate</h4>
          <p><strong>Status:</strong> Hated Pirates</p>
          <p><strong>Conflict:</strong> Voidborn raiders constantly strike Concord shipping and border worlds</p>

          <h4>Titan Order</h4>
          <p><strong>Status:</strong> Rival Philosophies of Order</p>
          <p><strong>Ideological Clash:</strong> Both claim to represent "true" order and stability</p>
          <p><strong>Military Opposition:</strong> Titan disciplined warfare against Concord's chaotic mass tactics</p>

          <h4>Shadowblade Mercenary Guild</h4>

          <p><strong>Pragmatic Use:</strong> Concord regularly hires Shadowblade mercenaries when their own forces prove insufficient</p>
          <p><strong>Mutual Suspicion:</strong> Both sides know the relationship is purely transactional</p>

          <p><strong>Power:</strong> Proof to zealots that faith can conquer shadow</p>
