      <h2>Ghost Legion</h2>
      <p>Elite operatives skilled in infiltration, sabotage, and intelligence gathering. Masters of the unseen war.</p>
      <figure style="text-align: center;">

        <figcaption>Symbol of the Ghost Legion</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3>Origins & Motivation</h3>
      <p>Born from necessity during the early rise of the Apex Separatist Consortium, the Ghost Legion was formed by defectors, spies, and criminals who possessed intimate knowledge of enemy tactics. Their philosophical core revolves around the belief that <strong>knowledge is power</strong> — wars are won before armies clash, through controlling information, disrupting logistics, and fracturing trust.</p>
      <p>The Legion sees itself as the Consortium's unseen blade, operating in the shadows while open warfare belongs to the Titan Order and Shadowblade Mercenaries.</p>

      <h3>Organizational Structure</h3>
      <p>Ghost Legion operates in layers of secrecy, with three distinct tiers:</p>

      <div class="tier-section">
        <h4>Shade Operatives</h4>
        <p><strong>The faceless infiltrators, moving unseen.</strong></p>
        <p>Field agents conducting infiltration, reconnaissance, and sabotage operations. Their identities are compartmentalized and often completely "ghosted." These operatives maintain the highest level of secrecy, operating with masked identities in the field.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="tier-section">
        <h4>Cipher Cells</h4>
        <p><strong>The analysts and code-breakers, hidden in the net.</strong></p>
        <p>Cryptographers, digital interceptors, and intelligence analysts who control stolen and manipulated information. Operating from remote, secure nodes, they coordinate operations with minimal direct communication while maintaining mid-high trust levels within their cells.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="tier-section">
        <h4>Veil Command</h4>
        <p><strong>The secret architects, unseen even by their own agents.</strong></p>
        <p>Strategic planners who decide infiltration targets, maintain Legion doctrine, and ensure plausible deniability for the Consortium. Operating under the highest secrecy levels, their identities may be known only to top-level Consortium leadership.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Methods & Tactics</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Infiltration:</strong> Using forged documents, planted sympathizers, and identity theft to penetrate enemy forces</li>
        <li><strong>Sabotage:</strong> Supply chain disruption, infrastructure tampering, and strategic misinformation campaigns</li>
        <li><strong>Intelligence Gathering:</strong> Signal interception, spy networks, and cyber-espionage operations</li>
        <li><strong>The "Phantom Weapon":</strong> Making operations appear to be conducted by other parties to sow distrust</li>
        <li><strong>Ghosting:</strong> Complete disappearance after missions, leaving no witnesses or records</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Resources & Capabilities</h3>
      <p>The Legion maintains an extensive network of safe houses across both Consortium and enemy territories, equipped with cutting-edge technology including signal jammers, cloaking devices, hacking tools, and biometric countermeasures. Their intelligence network spans sleeper agents, smugglers, and informants within official channels.</p>

      <h3>Internal Challenges</h3>
      <p>The Legion's strength in secrecy also breeds internal weaknesses. Isolation creates mistrust and paranoia among agents, while over-reliance on compartmentalization can slow critical decisions. The mental strain of maintaining double lives leads to high psychological casualties and internal faction disputes.</p>

      <h3>Inter-Faction Relations</h3>
      <p>Ghost Legion maintains complex relationships with other Consortium factions — complementary yet tense cooperation with the Titan Order, competitive collaboration with Specter Network in digital warfare, and cautious partnerships with both Shadowblade Mercenaries and the Voidborn Syndicate for logistics and transport.</p>

      <h3>Role in Consortium Goals</h3>
      <p>As the Consortium's advance guard, Ghost Legion enables strategic autonomy by opening pathways for larger operations. They sabotage enemy supply lines, gather forbidden knowledge, and anticipate enemy movements — serving as the invisible foundation upon which the Consortium's power rests.</p>
