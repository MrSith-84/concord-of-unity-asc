# Charter of the Diplomatic Corps
*Concord of Unity*

## Preamble
Where others bind with chains, the Concord binds with bridges. The **Diplomatic Corps** exists to translate will into accord, passion into policy, and difference into durable compacts—always aligned to the Council’s Pillars of **Harmony**, **Synthesis**, and **Reconciliation**.

## Article I — Mission & Powers
1. Prevent, de-escalate, or terminate conflict through negotiation, shuttle diplomacy, and confidence-building measures.
2. Draft, negotiate, and register **Bridge Charters**, transit treaties, and data‑exchange frameworks.
3. Orchestrate humanitarian corridors and evacuations in concert with Peace Keepers.
4. Maintain the **Harmonic Net** of liaisons, translators, and cultural advisors.
5. Conduct due diligence and verification for compliance with Council instruments (Edicts/Writs), including on‑site monitors.
6. Maintain a **Cipher-Ledger Annex** of treaty texts, protocols, and ratifications.

## Article II — Composition
- **High Envoy of Concord** (Chief of Corps; Council liaison).
- **Regional Envoys** (quadrant/sector leads; authority to initial provisional accords).
- **Mediators Guild** (specialists in ceasefires, sanctions relief frameworks, and dispute resolution).
- **Cultural & Language Directorate** (anthropologists, historians, interpreters, symbology analysts).
- **Verification & Compliance Office** (observers, inspectors, audit teams).
- **Logistics & Humanitarian Liaison** (UN/NGO analogs, convoy scheduling, evac coordination).

## Article III — Selection, Conduct, and Security
- Selection favors multilingual, cross‑cultural competency, and oath to civilian-first doctrine.
- **Conduct**: Honesty in representation; no private inducements; proactive conflict-of-interest disclosure.
- **Security**: Envoys travel under Concord safe‑conduct; operational secrecy is limited by transparency duties in Article VI.

## Article IV — Procedures
- **Bridge Plan**: Every mission files objectives, red lines, fallback positions, and **Reconciliation** deliverables.
- **Accord Ladder**: Statement of principles → technical working groups → verification protocols → phased implementation.
- **Mediation Windows**: Standard 72‑hour cooling-off period; extensions approved by High Envoy.
- **Joint Signals**: Shared communiqués to reduce misinterpretation; all drafts preserved in the Annex.

## Article V — Limits & Safeguards
- No coerced signatures; no secret annexes affecting civilian rights.
- Any accord impacting non‑combatants requires Peace Keeper concurrence on feasibility and protection measures.
- Violations trigger **Concord Writ** referral and potential corridor suspension.

## Article VI — Transparency
- Treaty texts published after signature; negotiation logs released within 180 days unless active risk persists.
- Annual **Accords Report** includes durability indices, dispute hot spots, and lessons learned.

**Seal & Oath**
“Let bridges hold.” — Corps oath upon commission.
