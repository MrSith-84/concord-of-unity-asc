# Charter of the Peace Keepers
*Concord of Unity*

## Preamble
Power without restraint is tyranny; restraint without power is surrender. The **Peace Keepers** stand where civilians stand, enforcing Concord instruments with a shield-first doctrine and a force continuum that answers to the law, the Council, and conscience.

## Article I — Mission & Powers
1. Protect non‑combatants, critical infrastructure, and humanitarian corridors.
2. Enforce **Concord Writs** and **Edicts of Unity**; escort envoys; secure verification teams.
3. Conduct evacuation, search‑and‑rescue, disaster response, and convoy defense.
4. Establish **Stability Bubbles**—temporary security perimeters around relief, voting, or mediation sites.
5. Maintain readiness for rapid deployment, including mobile field hospitals and comms relays.

## Article II — Structure
- **Marshal of Peace Keepers** (service chief; Council Custodian liaison).
- **Sector Marshals** (theater command; coordinate with Regional Envoys).
- **Rapid Response Groups** (RRG; light, airliftable units).
- **Stability & Civil Affairs** (SCA; policing, crowd management, civil liaison).
- **Evacuation & Relief Corps** (ERC; medevac, logistics, engineering).
- **Signals & ISR** (S2/S6 analogs; unarmed surveillance for treaty verification).

## Article III — Rules of Engagement (ROE)
- **Civilian-First**: Protect life and essential services above all other objectives.
- **Proportionality**: Force scales only to remove immediate threat; de‑escalation preferred.

- **Ethical Impact Review** sign‑off required for high‑risk operations (tri‑sign by the Triumvirs).
- **Community Liaison Cells** embedded with local leaders to reduce friction and rumor.
