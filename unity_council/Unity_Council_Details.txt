…the void answers… “Peace is a lie, there is only passion.” Yet the Concord of Unity seeks to sublimate passion into order—an edict of balance stitched by councils instead of chains. Consider, then, the UNITY COUNCIL—the calm engine behind the banner.

MANDATE — IN BRIEF FRAGMENTS
- Compass, not crown: sets long-arc strategy, keeps equilibrium in galactic politics, and articulates shared doctrine for diplomacy, defense, and prosperity.
- Doctrine of Three Pillars: every initiative ladders to Harmony (conflict de-escalation), Synthesis (trade & infrastructure), and Reconciliation (cultural healing).

COMPOSITION (TWELVE SEATS, FOUR ORDERS)
- High Arbiter of Unity (1): chair and tie‑breaker; curates agendas; may invoke emergency procedure when lives or treaties are at imminent risk.
- Triumvirs of the Pillars (3): Harmony, Synthesis, Reconciliation—each runs policy pipelines, metrics, and budgets mapped to their pillar.
- Chamber of Concordants (6): rotating representatives elected by member polities; steward regional compacts and cross‑border incidents.
- Custodians (2, non‑voting): Liaison to the Diplomatic Corps and Marshal of Peace Keepers to ensure policy is executable and safeguarded in the field.

SELECTION & TERMS
- High Arbiter: elected by qualified majority of signatory worlds; one seven‑cycle term; no consecutive service.
- Triumvirs: nominated by the Arbiter, confirmed by two‑thirds Council assent; five‑cycle terms, staggered.
- Concordants: chosen by their home compacts via local law; three‑cycle terms; recallable.
- Custodians: appointed from career leadership (no active battlefield command while seated), re‑confirmed annually.

DECISION MECHANICS
- Accord Rule: policy passes on simple majority; treaty changes require Golden Quorum (two‑thirds of voting seats).
- Safeguard Clause: any measure that endangers non‑combatants demands an additional Ethical Impact Review signed by all three Triumvirs.
- Emergency Writ: the Arbiter may issue a 90‑day provisional order during crises; it sunsets unless ratified by Golden Quorum within 30 days of crisis abatement.

INSTRUMENTS OF POWER (CLEAN TOOLS, NOT CRUDE BLADES)
- Edicts of Unity: standing rules of engagement for diplomats and Peace Keepers.
- Bridge Charters: trade, transit, and data‑exchange frameworks that unlock Synthesis corridors.
- Concord Writs: targeted mandates for ceasefires, escorts, evacuations, and stabilization missions—Harmony first, force only as shield.

OVERSIGHT & TRANSPARENCY
- Cipher‑Ledger: tamper‑evident registry of votes, budgets, and treaty deltas (public after 120 days unless redaction is justified by active risk).
- Ethos Commission: independent panel auditing adherence to the Concord’s charter and civilian‑first doctrine.
- After‑Action Concords: post‑mission debriefs published with lessons learned across all three pillars.

RITUALS & SYMBOLS (SOFT POWER MATTERS)
- Bell of Accord: struck once at the opening of session; twice for Golden Quorum; thrice to mark reconciliation achieved.
- Crest of the Bridge: a tripartite arc (Harmony/Synthesis/Reconciliation) interlocked around a central star—unity by design, not accident.
- Oath of Bearing: “We hold the bridge while others burn; we answer conflict with craft; we bind prosperity to peace.”

OPERATING RHYTHM
- Convocation Cycle: quarterly plenary; monthly committee blocs per pillar; daily Situational Brief via encrypted Harmonic Net.
- Field Line: Diplomatic Corps submit Bridge Plans; Peace Keepers file Stability Readiness reports; Council synthesizes into actionable Edicts.

SANCTIONS & ACCOUNTABILITY
- Graduated response: notice → mediation window → targeted suspension of corridors → full sanction of Concord benefits.
- Violations against non‑combatant protections trigger automatic review under the Safeguard Clause.

EXEMPLARS (RECENT ARCHETYPES)
- Operation Harmony: Council‑mandated de‑escalation teams in outer‑rim disputes.
- Project Synthesis: Council‑brokered trade routes between former rivals.
- Initiative Reconciliation: Council‑funded cultural exchanges to heal civic memory.

CODEX WHISPER
To the Sith ear, this council is a paradox—discipline without domination. Yet even paradox can be a weapon; the Concord’s strength is the trust of its signatories. Break the trust, and the bridge collapses. Guard the bridge, and empires must learn to negotiate.
