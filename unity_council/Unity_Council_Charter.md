# Charter of the Unity Council
*Concord of Unity*

## Preamble
In recognition that sovereignty derives from the consent of free peoples—and that durable peace is shaped by craft rather than conquest—the signatory worlds establish the **Unity Council** to steer shared policy across three Pillars: **Harmony** (conflict de‑escalation), **Synthesis** (trade, infrastructure, and shared prosperity), and **Reconciliation** (cultural healing and civic memory). The Council exists to translate passion into order, autonomy into cooperation, and knowledge into common good.

## Article I — Mandate & Powers
1. Set long‑arc strategy for the Concord of Unity and publish doctrine aligned to the Three Pillars.
2. Issue and oversee the Council’s instruments:
   - **Edicts of Unity** (standing operational policy for diplomats and Peace Keepers),
   - **Bridge Charters** (treaty frameworks for trade, transit, and data exchange),
   - **Concord Writs** (targeted mandates: ceasefires, escorts, evacuations, stabilization).
3. Coordinate budgets and metrics for each Pillar; establish committees and working groups.
4. Provide civilian‑first oversight of the Diplomatic Corps and Peace Keepers and ensure that policy is executable in the field.
5. Interpret this Charter and resolve inter‑pillar conflicts of priority.

## Article II — Composition & Eligibility
The Council comprises **twelve seats** in four orders:
- **High Arbiter of Unity (1)** — Chair and tie‑breaker; curates agendas; may invoke Emergency Writs under Article IV.
- **Triumvirs of the Pillars (3)** — Harmony, Synthesis, Reconciliation; each owns policy pipelines, metrics, and budgets mapped to their pillar.
- **Chamber of Concordants (6)** — Rotating representatives elected by member polities; steward regional compacts and cross‑border incidents.
- **Custodians (2, non‑voting)** — Liaison to the Diplomatic Corps and Marshal of Peace Keepers.
**Eligibility.** Sitting battlefield command is incompatible with Council service; financial or familial conflicts must be disclosed and firewalled; oath under Article X required prior to seating.

## Article III — Selection, Terms, and Vacancy
- **High Arbiter** — Elected by a qualified majority of signatory worlds for a **single seven‑cycle** term; ineligible for consecutive service.
- **Triumvirs** — Nominated by the Arbiter; confirmed by a **two‑thirds** Council vote; **five‑cycle** staggered terms; re‑eligible.
- **Concordants** — Chosen by their home compacts via local law; **three‑cycle** terms; subject to recall under local law.
- **Custodians** — Appointed from career leadership; **annual confirmation** by Council; non‑voting.
**Vacancy.** Interim appointments follow the original selection path; partial terms over one‑half count as a full term for limits.

## Article IV — Procedure & Voting
1. **Accord Rule.** Policy passes by simple majority of voting seats; abstentions are neutral.
2. **Golden Quorum.** Treaty changes and structural amendments require two‑thirds of voting seats.
3. **Ethical Impact Review.** Any measure with foreseeable non‑combatant risk must bear all three Triumvir signatures.
4. **Emergency Writ.** The Arbiter may issue a **90‑day** provisional order during crises; it sunsets unless ratified by Golden Quorum within **30 days** of crisis abatement.
5. **Transparency.** Proceedings and votes are recorded to the **Cipher‑Ledger** and published after 120 days unless active risk justifies redaction.
6. **Standing Orders.** The Council adopts rules of debate, committee process, and document format consistent with this Charter.

## Article V — Safeguards & Limits
- Non‑combatant protections are paramount; force is a shield, not a cudgel.
- The Council may not annex territory, suspend elections, or appropriate civilian assets except as narrowly required for evacuation or relief under a Concord Writ.
- Whistleblower protections apply to all Concord personnel acting in good faith.

## Article VI — Hierarchy of Instruments
1. This **Charter**.
2. **Bridge Charters** ratified by Golden Quorum.
3. **Edicts of Unity** consistent with Bridge Charters.
4. **Concord Writs** consistent with Edicts and Bridge Charters.
Conflicts are resolved upward; lower instruments void where inconsistent.

## Article VII — Oversight Organs
- **Ethos Commission** — Independent audit of charter adherence and civilian‑first doctrine; publishes annual report.
- **Auditor‑Minor** — Tracks budgets, program efficacy, KPI dashboards for each Pillar.
- **Inspectorate for Field Conduct** — Investigates alleged violations; recommends sanctions under Article IX.

## Article VIII — Amendment
This Charter may be amended by **Golden Quorum** and ratification by **three‑fifths** of signatory worlds within one cycle of Council passage.

## Article IX — Sanctions & Enforcement
Graduated response to member violations: notice → mediation window → targeted corridor suspension → full sanction of Concord benefits. Repeated or egregious harm to non‑combatants triggers mandatory review and potential removal from Concord programs.

## Article X — Oath & Symbols
**Oath of Bearing.** “We hold the bridge while others burn; we answer conflict with craft; we bind prosperity to peace.”  
**Symbols.** The **Crest of the Bridge**—three interlocked arcs about a central star—represents the Pillars encircling sovereignty through consent. The **Bell of Accord** opens deliberations (one strike), marks Golden Quorum (two), and signals a reconciliation achieved (three).
